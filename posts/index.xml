      <description>It’s just, some things put a charm on me, and those are the chimes of blessings
It’s been some time, and I say I am fine, and I realize what sets me free,
Why people describe children as avatar of gods,
Why chirping of birds as the midst of bliss,
‘Cause some things which you can’t prevent, hold your heart down
And you want to steal that felicity, from anyone</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s silly, isn&amp;rsquo;t it&amp;hellip;
Fighting for small things
Wishing you could hold some things to yourself
Selfish, totally
After all I told the idiots, to meet me that evening
But they were outside the campus
Having my favorite street food all by themselves
Bastards, I still comment that&amp;hellip;
But wishes for a sight, prevails still
Making the anger, bring on a different level
So angry, I said &amp;ldquo;What if it&amp;rsquo;s our last meet for now&amp;rdquo;</description>
