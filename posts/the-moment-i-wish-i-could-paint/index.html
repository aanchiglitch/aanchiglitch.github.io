        <p>It&rsquo;s silly, isn&rsquo;t it&hellip;<br>
Fighting for small things<br>
Wishing you could hold some things to yourself<br>
Selfish, totally<br>
After all I told the idiots, to meet me that evening<br>
But they were outside the campus<br>
Having my favorite street food all by themselves<br>
Bastards, I still comment that&hellip;<br>
But wishes for a sight, prevails still<br>
Making the anger, bring on a different level<br>
So angry, I said &ldquo;What if it&rsquo;s our last meet for now&rdquo;<br>
And heavens is known bad for granting you unwanted curses<br>
The country locked down, the college shut<br>
And sudden approaches to leave the city came the same morning<br>
There is nothing worse , then not seeing, not talking<br>
To some people, you don&rsquo;t know how you got connected with<br>
It hurts, and soaring you see the tickets<br>
Which don&rsquo;t excite you anymore<br>
&lsquo;Cause your home is where your heart is<br>
The croaking walls of cell, bad food and water doesn&rsquo;t really matter<br>
I kept packing, taking to someone who told me be happy<br>
But inside I was going insane, and even more&hellip;<br>
&lsquo;Cause with the rules and regulations<br>
There remains no chances to sight as I gain the insight<br>
Packed bags and all done&hellip;<br>
Pretty much no sleep&hellip;<br>
A cold water bath to keep conscious<br>
And help myself to with the load drowning my head<br>
It&rsquo;s 12:30 and I am listening to some song<br>
Which somehow cries of home and<br>
It&rsquo;s melodies send chills<br>
And my worthless phone rings<br>
Breaking in the continuous loop, bastards<br>
&ldquo;We are reaching in 5 minutes, get everyone you got<br>
and meet at our spot, right now&rdquo;<br>
My eyes brightened up&hellip; so I could see them<br>
There is no thing better<br>
I knew the places they meant right away, and<br>
Hurried with whatsoever left<br>
The smile which set me could not fade away<br>
And without any further delay<br>
We left for our way<br>
Somehow, they managed the leave they don&rsquo;t get<br>
You did the right thing, I was in a fortress of distress<br>
The railway station not so far, but every moment<br>
I had right then is what I rejoiced<br>
This time I would be gone, without the drinks<br>
Make sure idiots, next time don&rsquo;t forget this thing<br>
The train is at 6 and we are here by 1<br>
The 5 hours I had, are sure my best ones<br>
The night was partly cloudy<br>
But I could spot the stars<br>
The back seat of auto-rickshaw we seated in volunteering<br>
Those bad jokes and laugh, felt high itself<br>
It&rsquo;s partly dizzying, the rain,<br>
Cold swoosh of breeze  strangely exotic<br>
And then comes the scene ever hit in my head<br>
The one dark scene I want to paint to reality<br>
Alas! I am too bad for how lively it was<br>
I sat on some closed shops bench<br>
Having my &lsquo;Kulladh wali Chai&rsquo;<br>
The street was all black, lit by a single street lamp<br>
Near the only small shop open<br>
Which made world&rsquo;s best Chai and omelets<br>
And I couldn&rsquo;t help bit stare at both of the idiots<br>
Who meant quite much to me<br>
Having Chai and lighing up a smoke<br>
Watching there smiling faces as they had small conversation<br>
The shopkeeper was interactive as well<br>
And every move put so perfectly as if I am in a movie<br>
I told them not to get me omelet but as if they will hear me<br>
They got me, and fed me<br>
And I must be an idiot as well<br>
To make excuses of not touching the oil<br>
&lsquo;Cause let them feed me, I&rsquo;m sorry, I will steal that<br>
We were crazy dancing and jumping on empty street<br>
Playing football on silent platform with some crushed bottle<br>
We laughed crazily, eating and playing<br>
I will never grow up, say I&rsquo;m a kid to do these stupid things<br>
taking, hugging, what&rsquo;s infections, what&rsquo;s sanity?<br>
The night faded with the dawn<br>
And I am with you both<br>
My untimely leaving a secret<br>
Your leaving hostel a secret<br>
As the final hour approached, you got me to my seat<br>
The stop not few minutes, clear in all of our eyes<br>
How much we all will miss this, but can&rsquo;t leave with tears<br>
We will meet soon, we smiled and waved<br>
Keeping the emotions pressed, bastards<br>
The whistle came, and we shouted, every word a  slang<br>
&lsquo;Cause we mean it, making each other laugh<br>
And see smiles before we lost sight of them ,<br>
In the silent, silent platform&hellip;<br>
I&rsquo;m here now, at my house<br>
Not sure where my home is,<br>
And luckily get to hear your voices and see your faces<br>
Thanks to technology<br>
But that scene<br>
Of black night, cigarette smoke,<br>
Over salted eggs and dim street light,<br>
Those stars and mild rains<br>
Are ever stuck in my brain<br>
Your slightly wet, folded shirts<br>
Jackets I held, because you din&rsquo;t wear it<br>
Those colors, and smile<br>
Keeps coming to me again and again<br>
Sometimes as dreams, sometimes as nightmares<br>
But I am sure I miss that pure moment in every aspect<br>
Wish I could paint, what I see</p>
