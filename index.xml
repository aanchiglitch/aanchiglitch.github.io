      <description>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Aanchal Kumari ðŸ˜ƒ
You have reached my small place on the World Wide Web.
I considered myself a Polymath. I believe in rigorous and intuitive learning. Spend the majority of the time exploring different types of algorithms and making some cool UI. Currently, I am a 2nd year undergraduate at Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering Department. I am fascinated by the extensive impact computers can have on solving real-world problems.</description>

      <description>Itâ€™s just, some things put a charm on me, and those are the chimes of blessings
Itâ€™s been some time, and I say I am fine, and I realize what sets me free,
Why people describe children as avatar of gods,
Why chirping of birds as the midst of bliss,
â€˜Cause some things which you canâ€™t prevent, hold your heart down
And you want to steal that felicity, from anyone</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s silly, isn&amp;rsquo;t it&amp;hellip;
Fighting for small things
Wishing you could hold some things to yourself
Selfish, totally
After all I told the idiots, to meet me that evening
But they were outside the campus
Having my favorite street food all by themselves
Bastards, I still comment that&amp;hellip;
But wishes for a sight, prevails still
Making the anger, bring on a different level
So angry, I said &amp;ldquo;What if it&amp;rsquo;s our last meet for now&amp;rdquo;</description>
